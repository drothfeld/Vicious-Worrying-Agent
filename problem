(defproblem problem worry

  ; The initial facts of the mental state of the agent. The
  ; agent starts with some basic knowledge and a mental state
  ; to service as a catalyst for its vicious worrying. The agent's
  ; starting biological necessity levels are also set here, which
  ; will be constantly updated as the agent simulates vicious worrying.

  ; Biological necessity level values range from 0 to 100 (completely
  ; unfulfilled to fully fulfilled respectively).



  ; This problem definition defines an agent who starts in a medium/average
  ; mental state. Biological necessities are all midway and there is a single
  ; item of worry to serve as a spark.

  (
    ; BIO LEVELS: (unsatisfied) 0 -- 100 (satisfied)
    (bio-level hunger me 50)
    (bio-level bladder me 50)
    (bio-level energy me 50)

    ; WORRY LEVEL: (calm) 0 -- 100 (freaking out)
    (bio-level worry me 50)

    ; MEMORY TO START WORRY: worry(SUBJECT, EVENT/STATUS)
    (worry-memory me worry(car crash))
  )



  ; The starting method. The agent's goal is it stop worrying (reduce the worry-level
  ; value to 0), so we will call the stop-worrying method as the starting point.
